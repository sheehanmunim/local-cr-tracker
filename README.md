# Local CR Tracker

A local-first change request tracker for engineering teams. It runs as a
downloadable GitHub project with:

- Next.js App Router for the web UI
- Convex local deployments for the reactive database and server functions
- Ollama with auto-selected local models for CR questions, screenshots, and voice
- Local Moonshine speech-to-text and Kokoro text-to-speech for voice mode
- Tailwind, shadcn/ui primitives, and lucide icons

## Features

- Create, edit, archive, filter, and export CRs
- Track status, priority, risk, owner, requester, system, due date, impact, and technical notes
- Add update notes and status-change history
- Ask a local model about blockers, ownership, risk, and review priorities

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Ollama installed locally

The launcher auto-selects a local model profile. Smaller machines use the
`fast` profile, machines with at least 12 GB RAM use `balanced`, and larger
machines use `quality`. Each profile ranks candidate models by speed, answer
quality, memory fit, and whether the model is already installed. You can
override the profile with `LOCAL_MODEL_PROFILE=fast`, `balanced`, or `quality`,
or pin individual models with `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_VOICE_MODEL`, and
`OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL`.

## One-Command Local Setup

Clone the repo, then run the launcher for your OS.

Windows:

```powershell
.\start-windows.cmd
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash ./start-unix.sh
```

That command will:

- install Node.js/npm if missing
- install Ollama if missing
- install npm dependencies
- start Ollama if it is not already running
- pull the selected local Ollama models if they are not already installed
- save the resolved local model choices into `.env.local`
- configure/start a local Convex deployment
- start the Next.js app

Open the app:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

On first run, Convex writes `.env.local` with the local deployment URL. That
file is intentionally ignored by Git.

You can also run the scripts directly:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-local.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

To install everything without starting the server yet:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-local.ps1 -SetupOnly
```

```bash
bash ./scripts/start-local.sh --setup-only
```

If Node/npm and Ollama are already installed, this shorter command also works:

```bash
npm run local
```

## Optional Configuration

Create `.env.local` or use your shell environment:

```bash
LOCAL_MODEL_PROFILE=auto
# Optional: pin exact models to bypass adaptive local selection.
# OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.5:4b
# OLLAMA_VOICE_MODEL=gemma3:4b
# OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL=granite3.2-vision:2b
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
KOKORO_MODEL=onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX
KOKORO_VOICE=af_heart
KOKORO_DTYPE=q8
LOCAL_STT_MODEL=onnx-community/moonshine-tiny-ONNX
LOCAL_STT_DTYPE=q8
LOCAL_STT_DEVICE=cpu
```

Recommended clone-friendly defaults live in
[`config/local-models.json`](./config/local-models.json). It has separate
candidate lists for text chat, live voice, and screenshots, so the app can keep
voice fast while still using a stronger text or vision model when the machine
can handle it. Setting an individual `OLLAMA_*` model pins that role exactly and
skips adaptive ranking for that role.

Voice input and output are local as well. The first dictation or voice-chat run
downloads and caches the Moonshine speech-to-text model and Kokoro TTS model;
after they are cached, set `LOCAL_STT_OFFLINE=1` and `KOKORO_OFFLINE=1` if you
want to force fully offline voice mode.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run local          # install dependencies, ensure local models, start local app
npm run setup          # install dependencies and local models without starting the app
npm run models         # ensure/pull local Ollama models and update .env.local
npm run dev:local      # local Convex + Next.js, after setup
npm run convex:local   # local Convex only
npm run lint           # lint the repo
npm run build          # production build
npm run start          # ensures local models, then starts the production build
```

## Notes

- This project is designed for local development and local data. Convex local
  deployment state lives in `.convex/` and `.env.local`.
- The assistant route calls only your local Ollama server. Voice recognition and
  speech output use locally cached ONNX models. The app does not use a hosted
  LLM API.
