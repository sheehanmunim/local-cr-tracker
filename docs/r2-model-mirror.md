# Cloudflare R2 Model Mirror

Use this when `ollama pull` works for the maintainer but fails on corporate
networks. The maintainer uploads GGUF model artifacts to Cloudflare R2 once, and
fresh clones download from the approved R2/custom-domain URL without contacting
Ollama's public model registry.

This repo disables Ollama registry fallback by default, so corporate laptops
will only use installed Ollama models, local GGUF artifacts, or the configured
R2/custom-domain mirror. Set `OLLAMA_DISABLE_REGISTRY_FALLBACK=0` only on
maintainer machines that are allowed to run `ollama pull`.

## 1. Prepare The GGUF Artifact

Put the model file where the launcher expects it:

```bash
.cache/ollama-models/qwen3.5-4b.gguf
.cache/ollama-models/gemma3-4b.gguf
```

The configured artifact names live in [`config/local-models.json`](../config/local-models.json).
For a custom filename or checksum, edit the `artifacts` entry:

```json
{
  "artifacts": {
    "qwen3.5:4b": {
      "fileName": "qwen3.5-4b.gguf",
      "sha256": "optional-64-character-sha256"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Authenticate Wrangler

Wrangler is installed with the project dev dependencies, so run `npm install`
first if this is a fresh checkout.

Use either an interactive login:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Or set a Cloudflare API token with R2 bucket/object permissions:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="..."
```

## 3. Create The Bucket, Connect A Domain, And Upload

Production-friendly setup uses a custom domain that is already in the same
Cloudflare account as the R2 bucket:

```bash
npm run models:r2 -- --bucket ecc-local-models --domain models.fourechelon.com --prefix ecc
```

That command will:

- create the R2 bucket if needed
- connect the custom domain to the bucket
- upload configured local GGUF artifacts to `ecc/<file-name>.gguf`
- split large artifacts into `ecc/<file-name>.parts/part-0000` chunks when
  Wrangler cannot upload the file in one request
- upload `ecc/<file-name>.manifest.json` so fresh clones can reassemble chunks
- write `OLLAMA_MODEL_MIRROR_BASE_URL` to `.env.local`
- write `mirrorBaseUrl` to `config/local-models.json`

Commit the updated `config/local-models.json` after the mirror URL is correct.
Fresh clones will then use the R2 mirror automatically.

## 4. Upload New Artifacts Later

After replacing or adding files under `.cache/ollama-models`, upload again:

```bash
npm run models:r2:upload -- --bucket ecc-local-models --mirror-url https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc
```

The upload is resumable. If it is interrupted, rerun the same command; existing
remote chunks with the expected size are skipped.

To only save the public mirror URL into local env and committed config:

```bash
npm run models:r2:env -- --mirror-url https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc
```

## Development URL Option

For a quick smoke test without a custom domain:

```bash
npm run models:r2 -- --bucket ecc-local-models --dev-url --prefix ecc
```

Cloudflare's `r2.dev` public URL is intended for non-production traffic, is
rate-limited, and can be blocked by corporate DNS policy. Use the custom domain
for corporate distribution.

## Corporate Network Troubleshooting

Fresh clones use `https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc` by default. If startup
uses committed chunk manifests from `config/model-manifests/` so it does not
need to fetch `.manifest.json` files over the corporate network. If startup
fails while downloading mirrored artifacts, first confirm the laptop can reach a
model chunk:

```powershell
curl.exe -I https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc/qwen3.5-4b.gguf.parts/part-0000
curl.exe -I https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc/gemma3-4b.gguf.parts/part-0000
```

The launcher tries Node's built-in HTTPS client first, then retries mirror
downloads through `curl`, then on Windows retries through PowerShell with a BITS
fallback. These paths give corporate proxy settings, TLS inspection, and
Windows-managed download policies a better chance of being honored. HTTP paths
send a browser-like `User-Agent`, which can be overridden with
`OLLAMA_MODEL_MIRROR_USER_AGENT` if a corporate proxy requires a specific
allowlisted value.

If Chrome can download the chunk URL but Node, `curl`, PowerShell, or BITS all
return 403, use the browser downloader:

```text
https://models.fourechelon.com/ecc/model-downloader.html
```

Open that page in Chrome or Edge, select the cloned `local-cr-tracker` folder,
and wait for it to save the configured artifacts into
`.cache/ollama-models`. Then rerun `npm run local`. The launcher will validate
and import those local GGUF files without downloading them through a blocked
command-line process.
